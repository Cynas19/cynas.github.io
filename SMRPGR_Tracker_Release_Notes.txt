SMRPG Randomizer Tracker 1.0 by Cynas Release Notes!

Thank Yous

First and foremost, thanks to the following people; without their help, this project would never have gotten off the ground:
-Emosaru (core, troubleshooting, release)
-Beenieweenie (troubleshooting, idea exchange)
-JRJathome (troubleshooting)
-Natalie (troubleshooting)
-Fouton (inspirational design, code layout)

What's in the Package

The install comes with several layout options (you can change them easily by clicking the gear icon, "installed packages", "SMRPG Randomizer Tracker by Cynas", and pick the layout you like best):

-Items Only (stars, keys, flags, key progression items) - many of these icons are "progressive", and clicking the icon has multiple stages - in open mode, you may wish to note not only when you acquire a key item, but when use it/turn it in.

-Items with Characters - in addition to the above, adds portraits of the player characters.  In open mode, you have the option of randomizing your starting party member(s) and those that you encounter later in the game.  These portrait panels indicate to your audience the characters you've recruited thus far.

-Items with Characters and Bosses - adds bosses to the tracker in addition to the above.  Because of the boss shuffle option in open mode randomizer, none of these icons are progressive, however, right-clicking the portrait will place a checkmark over the boss portrait.  This is in place so that you can not only mark bosses as defeated (left-click), but also check off the location checked as well (right-click).

Other Features and Future Plans

Variable Sprites for Icons
Lots of work went into creating icons that are memorable and interesting, and even the fonts are ripped from the game for a very authentic look.  So much so that Yardovich broke the tracker once.  Refights have different sprites to keep things interesting, and make your stream look awesome, just like the randomizer you're playing!

Full Chathud Support
The command list for ChatHUD is ever growing for this pack.  If you need help activating ChatHUD for your new tracker, send me a DM, or parse the discord for Emosaru's release notes to enable ChatHUD (I can also tell you how to add custom commands for each icon on the tracker).  Below is a link to the pastebin that has a full list of working commands for each icon on the tracker.

Layout Update
The layout is just okay.  I have a couple more ideas I'd like to implement when I get more time:
-Changing the star layout to be more like games star pieces screen.  I'd like to have an alternative layout that instead of organizing bosses in chronological order, has them grouped (e.g. jagger, jinx1, jinx2, and jinx3 all in the same row).
-Multiple grids of different sizes.  There's a few blank spaces that I can eliminate that is easy to do on paper, but difficult for me to execute in code.
-Additional parameter tracking.  I'd like to add icons that allow you to track the number of FP and treasure chests checked.

Thank you for considering my (first) tracker.  I'm open to feedback and ideas for improvements!
